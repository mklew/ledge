      <p>Allows hinting the component's constructor arguments of aggregated types. Both Java
      arrays and java.util.Collection objects are supported. The elements of the sequence are
      <code>org.picocontainer.Parameter</code> objects - they may resolve to constants,
      component references, or nested sequences.
      </p>

      <p>A planned change: It's relatively easy to modify Pico in such a way that it wouldn't
      be necessary to explicitly state the expected type of the sequence. This information can
      be extracted from the constructor.</p>
