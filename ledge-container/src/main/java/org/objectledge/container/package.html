ObjectLedge container class for application composition and main class for command line
applications.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
A container a provides the environment in which components may operate.
It instantiates the components, connects them together (this is called compositioning), 
manages their lifecycle (notifies them about system startup and shutdown), provides them with 
logging facilities and configuration. The container may also provide run-time administrative 
functionality, from log verbosity adjustments, through component reconfiguration and JMX-enabled 
components management to aspect weaving/unweawing and component implementation hot swapping.
</p>

<p>
ObjectLedge container builds on the excelent
<a href="http://picocontainer.org" class="externalLink" title="External Link">PicoContainer</a> 
and <a href="http://nanocontainer.org" class="externalLink" title="External Link">NanoContainer</a> 
packages. Thanks to their flexible design, we were able to create a number of 
{@link org.objectledge.pico extensions} necessary to implement configuration and
logging facilities of our container that can be seamlessly plugged into Pico/Nano.
</p>

<h2>Compositioning</h2>
<p>
The composition of components is described using an XML file. We are using a custom
implementation of the <code>org.picoextras.script.xml.XmlFrontEnd</code> that is 
a bit more expressive than the one found in NanoContainer (but we'd love to see our changes
folded back to Nano!) See the {@link org.objectledge.pico extensions} page for 
more details.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
The components are configured using separate XML files. This makes locating the settings
of a particular component easier than with a single XML or properties file. It is also
more friendly to revision control systems, splitting the configuration into semantically
distinct items. All of the configuration files are subject to schema checking in order to 
detect configuration problems early, and without the need to write boiler plate java code.
We have chosen <a href="http://relaxng.org" class="externalLink" title="External Link">RelaxNG</a> schema language, because it is 
compact and easy to read. We use simple naming scheme to associate the component with it's
configuration file and the configuration schema. If a component class name is 
<code>com.wombat.Printer</code> the configuration file name is 
<code>com.wombat.Printer.xml</code> and the schema file path in the classpath is
<code>com/wombat/Printer.rng</code>. To be more specific, the containter derives the
names from the <i>role</i> of the component in the system. In simple cases it is equivalent
to the component's class name, but usually it is the name of an interface the component
implements, that the other components depend on.
</p>
<p>
The configuration of a component, read from the XML file is passed to the component as an
instance of <code>org.jcontainer.dna.Configuration</code> interface. All you need to do
is to declare a parameter of that type in your component's constructor.
</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>
A similar facility is provided for logging. If your component declares an
<code>org.jcontainer.dna.Logger</code> parameter in the constructor, it will be passed
a logger instance. All the loggers are configured by a single component, the 
{@link org.objectledge.logging.LoggingConfigurator}, 
that will also provide runtime verbosity adjustment facilities in the future.
</p>

<h2>Lifecycle</h2>
<p>
We are using standard facilities of the PicoContainer for the management. A component
that implements <code>org.picocontainer.lifecycle.Lifecycle</code> will be notified about
the container's startup, shutdown, and disposal.
