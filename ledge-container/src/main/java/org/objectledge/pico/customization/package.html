<p>
The component customization mechanism introduces a concept of customized (polymorphic)
components. When a customized component is requested during instantiation of a target component, 
a provider class is asked for an actual object instance, depending on the target component's key 
and implementation class.
</p>

<p>
To use this mechanism, you need to use
<code>CustmomizingConstructorComponentAdapter</code> instead of 
<code>ConstructorComponentAdapter</code> for instantiating your compoments.
Additionally you need to register 
<code>CustomizedComponentAdapter</code> for each of the components you want polymorphic,
using apropriate <code>CustomizedComponentProvider</code> objects.
