    <subsection name="Introduction">
      <p>
        ObjectLedge Maven plugin was created in order to automate some tasks performed during 
        development of applications. We use Maven for developing ObjectLedge and our ObjectLedge
        applications so this was the most convinien solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future the plugin will conain infrastructure necessary to embed an ObjectLedge
        container in Maven, and expose any Pico-compatible components as Jelly tags. This way
        users will be able to use their components in yet another environment, writting very
        little glue code.
