        <p>This is an implementation of the FileSystemProvider that delegates it's functionality
        to the <code>javax.servlet.ServletContext.getResource(String)</code> calls. 
        Stat operations, directory existence checking and listings are supported only if there 
        are listing files available. The ObjectLedge Maven plugin is able to generate these files 
        automatically.</p>

      <subsection name="Upload">
        <p>The Upload component is the implementation of the pipeline processing valve,
        that is run at very early stage of the pipeline processing. When it discovers the
        "multipart/form-data" it starts to process the request storing the uploaded items into 
        the context.
