        <p>Coral is as an object oriented database. It manages structured resources, that 
        can be mapped to Java objects in a JDBC relational database. </p>
        <p>Besides simple object persistency mechanism Coral provides an expressive security system, 
        many kinds of resources relations (intrinsic tree organization or resources, 
        reference attributes, set theory relations) and a powerful query facility that 
        can use attribute values and resource relations to select objects from the 
        store.</p>
        <p>The resources can be manipulated through Java API, or interactively using
        RML script language. Resource types can be created and modified at runtime 
        (existing resource instances are aproprietly adjusted). Java wrapper sources for
        the resources can be genereated using a Maven plugin from RML scripts, or a live
        database instance. Datatype schemata and security information can be exported
        to RML scripts, and resources can be imported/exported using XML.</p>

        <p>Cyklotron is a content management system - an application for easy development and 
        management of websites. </p>
        <p> Cyklotron project is sponsored by major player in the Non Governmental Organizations

        action on these major NGO websites in Poland: 
        <a href="http://www.ngo.pl">http://www.ngo.pl</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.niepelnosprawni.info">http://www.niepelnosprawni.info</a>. The aim of 
        this project is creating a next generation of Cyklotron software, that is faster more robust
        and easier to use, and providing it to the wide public.</p>
        <p>It is developed as an Open Source project, and is based on a large number of open source 
        libraries and tools. The software developed in the course of the project will be available
