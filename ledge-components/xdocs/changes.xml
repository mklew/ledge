      <action dev="fil" type="update">
        <code>FileServiceProvider</code> implementations were moved to <code>org.objectledge.filesystem</code>
        package, as they are accessed by the casual users - they should not be forced to look into impl packages.
      </action>
      <action dev="fil" type="update">
        <code>FileSystem.getResource(String)</code> method returns now actual URL pointing
        to the found files, as returned by the providers. These URLs can be safely serialized
        as Strings, and deserialized in any context. This allows using them as InputSource
        systemIds, with correct semantics.
      </action>
      <action dev="fil" type="update">
        <code>XMLValidator</code> API was changed so that it accepts URLs not FS paths.
        This makes XMLValidator independent of FileService, but retaining the functionality,
        thanks to <code>FileService.getResource()</code> method.
      </action>
      <action dev="fil" type="fix">
        XMLValidator is now compatible with Crimson and Xerces parsers, Saxon is not 
        required any longer.
