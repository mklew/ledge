      <subsection name="Introduction">
        <p>
	      This module contains a library of reusable IoC type-3 components. Some of them are used
	      by ObjectLedge basic and optional modules, others were designed for application use.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Scope">
        <p>
          Components in this module are environment agonstic - they can be used in command line,
          servlet or embedded environment without any modifictations, and they are configured
          in each of these in the same fashion. They may interact with different other components
          depending on the environment - but this is outside component's field of view.
        </p>

      <subsection name="Compatibility">
        <p>
          You integrate any Pico-compatible components into your ObjectLedge application out of the
          box. Integrating ObjectLedge components into other Pico-compatible containers is also
          possible but reqires slightly bigger effort: You need to use some of the pico extensions
          we have developed to instatiate them (see 
          <a href="../ledge-container/pico-extensions/ComponentCustomization.html">component customization</a>).
